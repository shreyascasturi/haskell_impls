-- The hangman game will ask users
-- for a choice of word or a word from a dictionary API,
-- and the user will have to fill in the letters of the word.
-- The user will have 5 chances for incorrect letters; if the user loses all chances they lose the game.
-- DESIGN
-- the parts of the design:
-- 1. given a character, check if it is in the string.
-- 2. If the character is not in the string, then decrement a counter for remaining chances.
-- 3. Related -> draw a hangman in successive steps.
-- 1a. Draw head and stick torso/body
-- 1b. Draw right arm
-- 1c. Draw left arm.
-- 1d. Draw right leg
-- 1e. Draw left leg.

-- LOGIC OF STATE
-- How do we represent the "state" of the game?
-- Naturally, we need a tuple. Let the tuple be 
-- State = (remaining chances/hangman sketch, WordItself, UserFacingString)
-- The UserFacingString will have dashes to represent unfilled/unknown characters.
-- When a guess is correct (the letter is in the string), the UserFacingString will update the location
-- that contains the character to display the character. The WordItself will substitute the actual letter
-- to be a dash.

-- Over time, this means the WordItself will become only dashes, and the UserFacingString will become the real word.
